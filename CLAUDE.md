# bootstrap.sh

A Go CLI that bootstraps a fresh macOS install: Homebrew + Brewfile, dotfiles, macOS preferences. Installable in one command on a truly fresh machine (only `curl` required).

---

## Architecture

Monorepo. This repo contains both the CLI tool's Go source and the dotfiles it manages.

The binary is distributed as a prebuilt artefact via GitHub Releases. `install.sh` downloads it and drops it on `$PATH` (`/usr/local/bin`). On first run the binary's `preflight` clones this repo to a known location on disk (default `~/.bootstrap.sh/`). From then on, the binary uses the clone as the live source for symlinks. Edits to symlinked files write through to the clone, so changes can be committed and pushed back upstream — the dev workflow is normal git.

The Go source ends up on disk alongside the dotfiles inside the clone. It is unused at runtime (the binary on `$PATH` is already built) — accepted as harmless dead weight in exchange for a single-curl install with no Go required on the user's machine.

### Install flow (fresh Mac)

User runs:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nednella/bootstrap.sh/main/install.sh | bash
```

`install.sh` is **light** — it only:

1. Downloads the latest prebuilt `bootstrap-darwin-arm64` from GitHub Releases (via the `releases/latest/download/` redirect).
2. Drops it on `$PATH` at `/usr/local/bin/bootstrap` (sudo only if the directory isn't writable).

Homebrew and the repo clone are **not** install.sh's job — `preflight` (run inside the binary before any job) ensures Homebrew → git → repo clone. Re-running install.sh just refreshes the binary.

### Runtime flow

After `install.sh`, the binary is on `$PATH`. Every job command runs `preflight` first (ensure Homebrew → git → repo clone), then operates against the clone:

- `bootstrap install` — runs `brew bundle` against `<install_path>/Brewfile`.
- `bootstrap dotfiles` — symlinks `<install_path>/dotfiles/` into `$HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` per the convention below. Existing files get backed up to `~/.dotfiles-backup/<timestamp>/` first.
- `bootstrap macos` — runs the macOS settings job.

### Update flow

`bootstrap update` is a single command that updates both binary and content:

1. Checks GH releases for a newer binary; if newer, downloads and replaces self at `/usr/local/bin` (sudo).
2. Stash-aware `git pull` on the clone:
   ```
   git status --short            # any uncommitted changes?
   git stash -u                  # if dirty, stash including untracked
   git pull
   git stash pop                 # if we stashed, restore
   ```

Local edits to symlinked dotfiles survive the pull. To push local edits upstream: `cd ~/.bootstrap.sh && git commit && git push`. Standard git.

---

## Configuration

A YAML config (`internal/config/default_config.yaml`) is embedded into the binary via `//go:embed`. To change defaults, edit the YAML in source and release a new binary.

CLAUDE.md does not duplicate the defaults — see the YAML file for what's configurable.

There is no runtime config-file overlay (yet). Single-user tool; the embedded YAML is the source of truth.

---

## Dotfiles convention

The `dotfiles/` tree is flat: one directory per program. Within each program directory, the symlink destination is determined by a single rule:

- Files starting with `.` are symlinked relative to `$HOME`.
- Files not starting with `.` are symlinked relative to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/<program>/`.

| Source | Destination |
|---|---|
| `dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc` | `~/.zshrc` |
| `dotfiles/git/.gitconfig` | `~/.gitconfig` |
| `dotfiles/ghostty/config` | `~/.config/ghostty/config` |
| `dotfiles/starship/starship.toml` | `~/.config/starship/starship.toml` |

No metadata files needed — the dot prefix carries the intent.

## Command surface

```
bootstrap                 # run all jobs in order (install, dotfiles, macos)
bootstrap install         # install packages from Brewfile
bootstrap dotfiles        # symlink dotfiles into $HOME / XDG
bootstrap macos           # apply macOS preferences
bootstrap update          # update binary + pull latest content

--dry-run                 # global flag; print what would happen, change nothing
```

CLI is built with **Cobra**. `main.go` is thin (wires the root command, defers everything else to `cmd/`).

`cmd/` is the *interface* layer (Cobra). `internal/jobs/` is the *logic* layer. Same shape as API endpoint ↔ service.

## Conventions

### Terminology

The unit of work is always a **job**. Never "phase", "step", or "task".

### Language

British English (en-GB) in commits, comments, prose, and identifiers I control (`colour`, `behaviour`, `initialise`). Standard Go stdlib names stay American (`color.Color`, etc.) — those are not mine to control.

### Go style

Never write `if err := foo(); err != nil { ... }`. Split assignment onto its own line:

```go
err := foo()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Declaration order

A function called by a neighbouring function — a helper in a local call chain — sits in execution (reading) order, caller above callee (see `internal/jobs/preflight.go`, `internal/jobs/dotfiles.go`). A function only ever called from elsewhere — an independent primitive or entry point — is ordered alphabetically (see `internal/utils/os.go`).

### Casing

Standard Go: exported identifiers `PascalCase`, unexported `camelCase`, initialisms all-caps (`URL`, `ID`, `HTTP`). Never export a helper purely so another package can reach it — that breaks the casing consistency of its sibling helpers. Route the cross-package call through the package's public entry point instead.

### Comments

Code should be self-descriptive — comments should not be needed. Don't write doc or inline comments; reach for clearer names instead. Compiler directives (`//go:embed`) are not comments and stay.

### Style var naming

Prefix style vars with the feature that consumes them: `headerArrowStyle`, not `arrowStyle`.

### Commit discipline

"and" / "&" in a commit subject means the commit should be split into multiple commits. One logical change per commit. Subject-only — no commit body unless genuinely load-bearing.

### Command framing

Describe commands (Cobra `Short`/`Long`, README usage, command-surface lines) by the **primary action**. Prerequisites and defensive checks are implementation detail, not user-facing copy.

## Milestones

Remaining milestones are ordered by the planned order of work.

- [x] **M1** — Cobra CLI skeleton: root command, subcommand dispatch, help text (no job logic yet)
- [x] **M2** — `internal/config`: embedded YAML loader (`go:embed default_config.yaml`)
- [x] **M3** — `internal/ui`: styled output, status messages, prompts
- [x] **M4** — dry-run plumbing: shell-out runner that honours `--dry-run`; everything destructive routes through it
- [x] **M5** — `install` job: `brew bundle` against the clone's Brewfile (Homebrew now ensured by preflight)
- [x] **M6** — `dotfiles` job: walk `dotfiles/<program>/`, symlink per convention; back up existing first
- [x] **M7** — `macos` job: macOS settings via `defaults write` (ByHost-aware), then restart affected services
- [ ] **M8** — `install.sh` (the curl one-liner): download `bootstrap-darwin-arm64` from the latest release and drop it at `/usr/local/bin` (sudo if needed). No Homebrew/clone logic in bash — `preflight` owns those.
- [ ] **M9** — release automation: `release-please` maintains the release PR and cuts a versioned release on merge; a `release-binary` workflow (on `release: published`) cross-compiles arm64 and attaches `bootstrap-darwin-arm64`. Needs the `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` PAT so the release event triggers the build.
- [ ] **M10** — `update` job: refresh binary from the latest release (sudo replace in `/usr/local/bin`) + stash-aware `git pull` on the clone
- [ ] **M11** — README polish, optional Homebrew tap (`brew install nednella/tap/bootstrap.sh`)

`preflight` (ensure Homebrew → git → repo clone, run from the root command before any job) was extracted during the install.sh redesign and is **done** — `internal/jobs/preflight.go`. It absorbs the Homebrew-install and clone steps M5/M8 originally bundled.

`internal/utils/` doesn't get its own milestone — fs/symlink helpers land in the same commit as the job that first needs them.
